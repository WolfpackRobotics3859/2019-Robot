#OLD CODE, NEW REPOSITORY MOVED TO https://github.com/WolfpackRobotics3859/2019-Familiaris-DeepSpace

# Wolfpack Robotics 3859: Robot Code
Team 3859's code for the C.I. Familiaris robot in the FIRST Deep Space Competition.

The code is formatted upon the WPI_Library command based robot in Java.

### Components
- Skid-Steer drive base with 6 motors and two gearboxes driven by TalonSRXs and VictorSPXs (WestCoast DriveTrain)
- Two "arms", rotating mechanisms utilizing TalonSRX MotionMagic to achieve set positions
- Other motors running basic percent-outputs on wheeled intakes, shooters, and belt drive linear slides
- Pneumatics in the hatch delivery mechanism and shifting gearboxes
- Pathfinder (Path Seeking, Curve Following, etc) Drive Capability
- Limelight Vision Integration
- "Overwatch" subsystem to maintain command triggering for unique driver inputs and code automation
- Input from Gyroscopes, IMUs, Accelerometers, Encoders, and Limit Switches.
